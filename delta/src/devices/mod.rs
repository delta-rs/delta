/// Represents a computational device that can be utilized for machine learning operations.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Cpu`: The central processing unit (CPU), available on all platforms.
///
/// - `Metal`: Represents a Metal-based device for macOS. This variant is only available
///   when compiled on macOS with the `metal` feature enabled. It includes:
///     - `device`: A `metal::Device` object representing the Metal device.
///     - `queue`: A `metal::CommandQueue` used for issuing commands to the device.
///
/// # Future Work
///
/// The following device types are planned for future support but are currently not implemented:
///
/// - `Cuda`: Support for NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA API.
/// - `OpenCL`: Cross-platform GPU support using OpenCL.
/// - `OpenCLCuda`: A specialized OpenCL implementation for NVIDIA GPUs.
/// - `Vulkan`: Cross-platform GPU support using the Vulkan API.
/// - `DirectX12`: Windows-based GPU support via DirectX 12.
/// - `Sycl`: Intel's SYCL API for heterogeneous computing.
/// - `Tpu`: Support for Google's TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).
/// - `WebGpu`: Lightweight GPU computing in browsers or embedded environments using WebGPU.
///
/// These variants are currently commented out in the codebase and will be introduced as the
/// framework evolves to support additional hardware platforms.
